## General Description
This is a survival delivery simulator, where you can buy items. Food and drinks replenish the user's food and hydration levels a certain amount, while Nonconsumables can be sold for a profit. When food and hydration levels reach zero the user dies. Each item takes a certain amount of time to be delivered. When the items are delivered they are automatically used. The user can then input a message to make a fixed amount of time pass. The user can also input messages to view their inventory and what's on sale.   
## Instructions
